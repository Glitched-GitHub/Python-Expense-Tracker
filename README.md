**Project Challenges and Solutions**

- Challenge:

  One of the main challenges was working with currency amounts.

- Solution:

  To solve this, instead of having the currency amount stored as a float i divided it by 100 so when it came to adding or subracting from it there was no rounding done.

- Challenge:

  Another challenge was getting the for loops to only extract the exact infomation required depending on what function was called.

- Solution:

  To solve this, i looked around the internet and researched many ways to utilize for loops and ended up using if statements within the for loops as this seemed like the simplest solution.
